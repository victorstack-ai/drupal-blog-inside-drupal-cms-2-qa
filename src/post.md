## The Q&A

**Q: What is the headline goal for Drupal CMS 2.0?**

**A:** The goal is to make Drupal feel immediately usable for real editorial teams, not just evaluators. That means a crisp first-run experience, stronger defaults, and a curated path from install to launch. It should feel like a product, not just a framework.

**Q: What problems are you trying to remove first?**

**A:** The early friction. Today, teams spend their first days wiring up content types, navigation, and roles. CMS 2.0 should reduce that by shipping with a credible starter architecture and by surfacing the right choices at the right time.

**Q: How do you balance flexibility with opinionated defaults?**

**A:** Defaults should be strong but reversible. If the default content model fits 60 percent of real projects, that is a win. The product should make the common path easy and the custom path obvious, not hidden.

**Q: What does success look like for the editorial experience?**

**A:** Success is when editors can publish without a training guide. The interface should explain itself through sensible names, consistent patterns, and clear affordances. When editors can self-serve, platform teams can focus on higher-order work.

**Q: What role does AI play in CMS 2.0?**

**A:** AI should be a productivity layer, not the product itself. Think of it as a co-pilot for content planning, metadata, and summarization, with transparent controls and a focus on trust. It should help editors move faster without breaking governance.

**Q: How are you thinking about content modeling?**

**A:** We want a default model that is realistic for common site types: marketing sites, program pages, and resource libraries. The model should include sensible fields, reusable components, and a clear relationship story so editors are not reinventing the wheel.

**Q: What is the biggest risk for the roadmap?**

**A:** Over-customization. If we try to satisfy every edge case in the default experience, the product becomes bloated and unclear. The discipline is to pick the primary audience and build for them first.

**Q: How do you measure community impact?**

**A:** In addition to adoption, we look at contribution paths. CMS 2.0 should make it easier for new contributors to understand where they can help, whether that is documentation, starter kits, or UI improvements.

**Q: What is a non-negotiable principle?**

**A:** Accessibility and content governance are not optional. They need to be first-class, not add-ons. CMS 2.0 should ship with defaults that make it easy to do the right thing.

**Q: What is one thing you want teams to feel after using CMS 2.0?**

**A:** Confidence. They should feel that the platform understands their needs and that they can launch quickly without sacrificing long-term maintainability.

## Closing Thought

A CMS release is only as strong as the teams it serves. The promise of Drupal CMS 2.0 is not that it does everything, but that it does the most important things with clarity, consistency, and a sense of product purpose.
